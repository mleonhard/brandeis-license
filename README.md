# LZX License

The LZX license is identical to the [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)
with added restrictions forbidding addictive design and
[dark patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern).

Software makers can provide their software under the LZX license.

Benefits:
- Anyone can use the software for free
- Discourages people from using the software in addictive or manipulative products
- Some protection from patent litigation

Limitations:
- LZX license is new.
  Companies and organizations must spend effort to evaluate and approve the
  license for internal use.  This means that LZX-licensed software may have
  slower adoption than Apache-licensed software.
- Unknown enforcement.
  No organization exists specifically to find and sue companies that violate the LZX license.
  Various non-profits may perform this work.

LZX license is not related to the [LZX compression algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZX).

## Who was LZX?

The license is named for [Lin Zexu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Zexu),
a government official who fought against the British narcotic drug trade in China.
In the 1800s, British companies produced opium (heroin) in India and sold it in China.

Lin Zexu wrote an open letter to the British monarchs:

> We find that your country is [twenty or twenty-five thousand miles] from China.
> The purpose of your ships in coming to China is to realize a large profit.
> Since this profit is realized in China and is in fact taken away from the
> Chinese people, how can foreigners return injury for the benefit they have
> received by sending this poison to harm their benefactors?
> 
> They may not intend to harm others on purpose, but the fact remains that
> **they are so obsessed with material gain that they have no concern whatever
> for the harm they can cause to others**. Have they no conscience?
> I have heard that you strictly prohibit opium in your own country,
> indicating unmistakably that you know how harmful opium is.
> You do not wish opium to harm your own country, but you choose to bring
> that harm to other countries such as China. Why? 
> 
> ...

The British monarchs did not reply.

The Chinese government banned opium, raided British warehouses,
and destroyed 1.2 million kg of opium.
The British government sent warships and attacked China,
murdered thousands of Chinese soldiers, destroyed the Chinese Navy,
and forced the Chinese government to sign an unequal treaty.
The treaty transferred Hong Kong to Britain and allowed British companies
to trade with Chinese people directly with little government oversight.
And the opium resumed flowing into China, ruining millions of lives.
See [First Opium War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Opium_War).

## Addicting Software
Today, massive companies are exploiting people all over the world with addictive software.
Addicting software is less addicting than opium (heroin),
but it still has a large negative effect on quality of life.
Companies make their software addicting to increase profits.
They invented new terms like "increasing engagement" so they don't have to say they are
addicting users.

Common addictive features:
- Social media likes
- Infinite scroll
- [Loot boxes](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/what-are-loot-boxes-microtransactions,news-26161.html) in games (gambling)
- Addictive game design

Largest & worst offenders:
- Facebook
- Instagram
- Snapchat
- TikTok
- WeChat.  WeChat app includes a TikTok clone inside the app.
  WeChat is required for normal social life in China so everyone
  has that sweet dopamine hit just one tap away and no way to uninstall it.
- Electronic Arts (EA)
- Blizzard
- King (Candy Crush)
- Zynga (FarmVille)
- and many others

## Dark Patterns
A [dark pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern)
is a user interface that has been carefully crafted to trick users into doing things
that help the software maker.

Common dark patterns:
- Re-checking the "subscribe to email newsletter" box after the user has un-checked it
- Allowing the user to filter by maximum cost, then showing them items that
  are more expensive than that cost
- Showing partial prices as if they were full price and revealing the full
  price after collecting user data (email, name, address, payment info, etc)
- Making privacy settings hard to find and confusing to use
- Replacing privacy settings with similar settings and automatically disabling those new settings
- Allowing users to sign up online but requiring them to make a phone call to cancel
- Requiring users to authorize recurring payments for time-based subscriptions

## Message to Makers of Addictive and Manipulative Software
We are free-software authors.

To the makers of addictive and manipulative software, we say "F*** YOU!"

We use the LZX license so you can't use our software.
If you do, we will sue.
And we will file takedown requests for violating our copyrights.

## LZX License Design
Requirements:
- Offer the same protections to authors as other popular licenses like Apache 2.0
- Apply restrictions to any product or service that is used with the software.
  This is similar to how the AGPL license works. 
  This should apply to using LZX-licensed tooling to support a product.
  Tooling includes monitoring, alarming, deployment, CI/CD, offline data processing, admin consoles, etc.
- When the license is updated, all previous contributions automatically get licensed under the new version
